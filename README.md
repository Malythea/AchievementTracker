# AchievementTracker
A mod for the MMO - The Elder Scrolls Online

This game mod was developed by Biki and was publically available at ESO UI shortly after the release of The Elder Scrolls Online. As a player of the game, I wanted some enhancements to the Tracker, so I quickly learned LUA in order to repair the bugs I had encountered and to enhance the mod for my own needs.

The full version history is available at http://esoui.com/downloads/info106-AchievementTracker. 

I worked with version 1.6 to create 1.7 and added the following features :
- Add the ability to see the exact number 'completed out of required' for a criterion (as I was interested in tracking the kill counts for the "Monster Hunter" title but this applied to a number of other achievements also);
- Remove the completed criterion when the option to 'hide completed' is selected in the settings;
- Save the option to show details for the tracked criteria.

The bugs I fixed were :
- When zoning or opening the map or a menu, the criterion being displayed was restricted to only one for each criteria;
- Criterion extended beyond the frame;
- Fixed details disappearing when opening/closing a menu.

These enhancements were made on the 21st of April, 2014.
